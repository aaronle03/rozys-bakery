Mock Retaurant Website created solely using HTML and CSS -- IN PROGRESS 

This is my first personal project using my newly learned skills of HTMl and CSS. I'm hoping to eventually revisit this website later on as I learn more front-end and back-end langauges and technologies. This websites inspiration and dedication to is my girlfriend Rozy who loves to bake!

GOALS
- Try to play around with various elements that I learn such as FlexBox, etc
- Try to incorporate some kind of working email list/newsletter
- Incorporate some kind of Google Maps, etc.
